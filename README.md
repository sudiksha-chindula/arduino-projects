## About

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects that I've worked on. For these projects, I have used a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) with Arduino IDE 2.3.6 and CH34xVCP driver.

## Stucture

Each folder corresponds to a project, whose contents can be found within the folder. Each such project also has a README file that describes the project in more detail.
